## When to Use Crosstalk

-   when Shiny not possible/practical, but interactivity needed
-   small/medium data sets
-   no user triggered specialized computations (statistics, derived columns)

## Other Ways to Achieve Interactivity

-   Server needed
    -   Shiny Server
    -   RStudio Connect
-   Own server not needed
    -   shiny on local server

    -   shinyapps.io

    -   Quarto with OJS

## Crosstalk Demo

-   crime in the Czech Republic based on policie.cz API

-   data contains:

    -   location (lat, long) - partially anonymized
    -   crime type (e.g. car accident, theft, burglary, fraud, drug-related crime etc.)
    -   crime status ([unresolved]{.underline}, [reported but not crime]{.underline}, [suspect charged]{.underline} etc.)

-   created in R flexdashboard package (RMarkdown for dashboards)
